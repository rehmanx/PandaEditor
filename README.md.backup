### Starting a new project
When you start PandaEditor a default project with some samples is setup for you.
Its located in current working directory and should no be deleted. You can use default project for any purpose, however to create a new project go to
**_Menubar > Project > Start New Project_** and choose a valid name and path.

### Assets management
* To import assets in your project go to **_Resource browser > Folder > Import Assets_**.
* In PandaEditor you can also append a folder outside of current working project, to append an external folder go to **_Menubar > Project > AppendLibrary_**, editor will start monitoring changes to any appended directory, the appended assets exists in you project like any other imported assets.

### Object manipulation 
* alt + right mouse button to rotate
* alt + middle mouse to dolly
* alt + left mouse button drag to zoom

### Runtime user modules

![Image](images//module.png)

PandaEditor has two states, Editor and Game state. Editor state is for level design, object manipulation, creating user modules and defining behaviors etc. and game state is what you would expect as final game view.  
Runtime user modules are only executed in game state, and any changes made to a user module in game state are reverted as soon as game state is exited, these are used to define behaviors of objects or nodepaths while in game state. 
A user module in PandaEditor is a python file which the editor loads as an asset, however for the editor to consider the python file as PandaEditor's user module,
* The python file should contain a class with same name as of python file.
* Class should inherit from PModBase.

To create a new user module **_Resource Browser > Project > ( select a folder, left click to open context menu ) > Add > UserModule_**.  
To see some example usages of user modules, see samples included with default project.  

### Editor plugins
Editor plugins are executed both in editor and game state. They inherit from PModBase, can be used to create tools and extend editor.  
To see some example usages of editor plugins, see samples included with default project.  

### Other
1. PandaEditor can also load and display .txt files, just import .txt files in your project like any other asset.
